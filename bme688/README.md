# getEnviData.py
This Micropython code reads temperature, humidity, pressure, and CO2 data from a BME688 sensor every second and saves it, along with a timestamp, to a file called "enviData.csv" on a micro SD card.



Required Libraries
utime module: provides functions for working with time
BME688 module: provides functions for reading data from BME688 sensor
os module: provides functions for working with the operating system
sdcard module: provides functions for working with a micro SD card

How the code works
The code imports necessary libraries and initializes the BME688 sensor and SD card.
The code creates a file called "enviData.csv" on the SD card.
The code enters a loop that runs indefinitely, reading data from the BME688 sensor every second.
For each set of data, the code retrieves the current time and formats it into a string.
The code writes the timestamp and data to the "enviData.csv" file on the SD card.
The loop continues to run indefinitely until the code is stopped.
This code demonstrates how to read data from a BME688 sensor and write it to a file on a micro SD card using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The code can be modified to read data from other sensors or to write data to other types of storage media.
